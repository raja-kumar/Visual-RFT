However, \"Crested Auklet\" is a specific species ( *Aethia cristatella*), while \"puffin\" is a more general term that could refer to other species like the Atlantic Puffin (*Fratercula arctica*) or Horned Puffin (*Fratercula corniculata*). Since the prediction is a broader category that encompasses the groundtruth, but not the exact same specific category, it is not considered a fine-grained match. The question asks if the groundtruth matches *any* of the predictions, and in this case, \"puffin\" is a correct broader classification, but not a fine-grained match to the specific species \"Crested Auklet\". The prompt states \"the strings need not match exactly but they must refer to the same specific category (not just broad class)\". \"Puffin\" is a broad class compared to \"Crested Auklet\".
